Provisional count of deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by county of occurrence, in the United States, 2020-2021.

Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICDâ€“10 code U07.1. Counties included in this table have more than one (1) death overall at the time of analysis. Number of deaths reported in this table are the total number of deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and do not represent all deaths that occurred in that period.
